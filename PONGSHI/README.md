# PING-PONG WITH SOUND

Created a game to learn python better and get the hang of its different properties.
<br>
Named it PONGSHI to give it a twist from the normal pingpong ;)
- Firstly making all the elements such as the paddles, ball etc
- Further assigning fucntions to all the elements and how they will interact.
- Adding to the fun, I included some sound effects.
