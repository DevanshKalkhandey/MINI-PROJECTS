DICE ROLL SIMULATER
#### install "-m pip install -U autopep8" to properly format python code.

- Import the random module to have access to all the functions included in the module.
- I have used the random.randint() function which returns a random integer based on the start and end.
- The smallest value of a dice roll is 1 and the largest is 6.
- This logic can be used to simulate a dice roll.
- Once a result is generate, the program can be re-run just by typing Y in console.
